# excel-to-markdown-table README

This VSCode extension converts Excel data to Markdown table format. Just a proof of concept.

Based on https://github.com/thisdavej/copy-excel-paste-markdown and the work of @jonmagic and @thisdavej

## Requirements

This extension depends on npm package `copy-paste`.

## Known Issues

* The extension tries to format all text, not just Excel data.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

Initial (very dirty) proof of concept
